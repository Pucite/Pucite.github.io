    <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <div>
          <p class="port"> Since age of 14 I have been involved in youth work activities. Started off as a membor of a youth group, I used many opportunities to volunteer, participate in competitions and organise events. These are examples of three of the mains projects that I have organised.  </p>

              <h4>Go to the countryside!</h4>
                <img id="projects" src="project3.jpg">
                <p>The main idea of the project was to bring people from cities to countryside to experience nature in more personal level. In order to organise this project, I had to apply and receive financial support from local municipality, form a team, find places that we could visit, and plan the whole program.  </p>

            <img id="projects" src="cirks2.jpg">
            <p> This project was organised within the ledership programm "Go Beyond". During the project me and my team designed outdoor activities that are inspired by the boardgame "Circus". The aim for the project was to provide free time activities for youngster during their summer holidays. </p>

          <h4> Top 10 future skills</h4>
          <img id="projects" src="project5.jpg">
          <p> This project was based on findings about the TOP 10 skills that employers will look for in their employees in 2020. The project aimed to raise awareness about these skills among pupils who haven't heard much about these skills in their academic classes. As a guest speakers, we lead workshops in 2 camps and organise roundtable discussion with experts in their field.</p>

      <h2> Design </h2>
      <div>
          <p class="port"> One of my passions is creating designs. Although I am still in the beginner stage, I hope to continue to develop my skills in the future. I enjoy creating visual materials that would convey information in a simple and engaging way. </p>

        <h2> Event hosting </h2>
        <div>
            <p class="port">Being in the front line is something that I truly enjoy. For many times I have had an opportunity to host events, write scripts, and lead teambuilding activities. An interest in public speaking comes from participation in impo theatre as well as from public speaking competiotions where I participated for 9 years. </p>
