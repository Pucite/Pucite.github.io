    <h2>Project Management</h2>
      <div>
          <p> Since age of 14 I have been involved in youth work activities. Started off as a membor of youth group, I used many opportunities to volunteer, participate in competitions and organise events. These are examples of three of the mains projects that I have organised.  </p>

              <h4>Go to the countryside!</h4>
                <img src="project3.jpg">
                <p>The main idea of the project was to bring people from cities to countrside to experience nature in more personal level. In order to organise this project, I had to apply and receive financial support from initiative competiotion, form a team, find places that we could visit, and plan the whole program. In addition, I was made informative materials to find participant and a report afterwards.  </p>
